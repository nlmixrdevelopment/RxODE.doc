# Single Subject solving

Originally, RxODE was only created to solve ODEs for one individual.
That is a single system without any changes in individual parameters.

Of course this is still supported, the classic examples are found in
[RxODE
intro](https://nlmixrdevelopment.github.io/RxODE/articles/RxODE-intro.html).

This article discusses the differences between multiple subject and
single subject solving. There are three differences:

- Single solving does not solve each ID in parallel
- Single solving lacks the `id` column in parameters(`$params`) as
  well as in the actual dataset.
- Single solving allows parameter exploration easier because each
  parameter can be modified. With multiple subject solves, you have to
  make sure to update each individual parameter.

The first obvious difference is in speed; With multiple subjects you
can run each subject ID in parallel.  For more information and
examples of the speed gains with multiple subject solving see the
[Speeding up RxODE](RxODE-speed.html) vignette. 

The next difference is the amount of information output in the final data.

Taking the 2 compartment indirect response model originally in the
tutorial:

```{r}
mod1 <-RxODE({
    KA=2.94E-01;
    CL=1.86E+01;
    V2=4.02E+01;
    Q=1.05E+01;
    V3=2.97E+02;
    Kin=1;
    Kout=1;
    EC50=200;
    C2 = centr/V2;
    C3 = peri/V3;
    d/dt(depot) =-KA*depot;
    d/dt(centr) = KA*depot - CL*C2 - Q*C2 + Q*C3;
    d/dt(peri)  =                    Q*C2 - Q*C3;
    d/dt(eff)  = Kin - Kout*(1-C2/(EC50+C2))*eff;
    eff(0) = 1
});

et <- et(amount.units='mg', time.units='hours') %>%
    et(dose=10000, addl=9, ii=12) %>%
    et(amt=20000, nbr.doses=5, start.time=120, dosing.interval=24) %>%
    et(0:240) # sampling
```

Now a simple solve
```{r}
x <- rxSolve(mod1, et)
x

print(x)

plot(x, C2, eff)
```

To better see the differences between the single solve, you can solve
for 2 individuals

```{r}
x2 <- rxSolve(mod1, et %>% et(id=1:2), params=data.frame(CL=c(18.6, 7.6)))
print(x2)

plot(x2, C2, eff)
```

By observing the two solves, you can see:

- A multiple subject solve contains the `id` column both in the data
  frame and then data frame of parameters for each subject.
  
The last feature that is not as obvious, modifying the individual
parameters.  For single subject data, you can modify the RxODE data
frame changing initial conditions and parameter values as if they were
part of the data frame, as described in the [RxODE Data
Frames](https://nlmixrdevelopment.github.io/RxODE/articles/RxODE-data-frame.html).

For multiple subject solving, this feature still works, but requires
care when supplying each individual's parameter value, otherwise you
may change the solve and drop parameter for key individuals.


## Summary of Single solve vs Multiple subject solving
| Feature     | Single Subject Solve                           | Multiple Subject Solve                                    |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Parallel    | None                                           | Each Subject                                              |
| $params     | data.frame with one parameter value            | data.frame with one parameter per subject (w/ID column)   |
| solved data | Can modify individual parameters with $ syntax | Have to modify all the parameters to update solved object |

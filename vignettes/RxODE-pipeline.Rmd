# Setting up the RxODE model for the pipeline

In this example we will show how to use RxODE in a simple pipeline.

We can start with a model that can be used for the different
simulation workflows that RxODE can handle:

```{r}
Ribba2012 <- RxODE({
    k = 100

    tkde = 0.24
    eta.tkde = 0
    kde ~ tkde*exp(eta.tkde)

    tkpq = 0.0295
    eta.kpq = 0
    kpq ~ tkpq * exp(eta.kpq)

    tkqpp = 0.0031
    eta.kqpp = 0
    kqpp ~ tkqpp * exp(eta.kqpp)

    tlambdap = 0.121
    eta.lambdap = 0
    lambdap ~ tlambdap*exp(eta.lambdap)

    tgamma = 0.729
    eta.gamma = 0
    gamma ~ tgamma*exp(eta.gamma)

    tdeltaqp = 0.00867
    eta.deltaqp = 0
    deltaqp ~ tdeltaqp*exp(eta.deltaqp)

    prop.err <- 0
    pstar <- (pt+q+qp)*(1+prop.err)
    d/dt(c) = -kde * c
    d/dt(pt) = lambdap * pt *(1-pstar/k) + kqpp*qp -
        kpq*pt - gamma*c*kde*pt
    d/dt(q) = kpq*pt -gamma*c*kde*q
    d/dt(qp) = gamma*c*kde*q - kqpp*qp - deltaqp*qp
    ## initial conditions
    tpt0 = 7.13
    eta.pt0 = 0
    pt0 ~ tpt0*exp(eta.pt0)
    tq0 = 41.2
    eta.q0 = 0
    q0 ~ tq0*exp(eta.q0)
    pt(0) = pt0
    q(0) = q0
})
```

This is a tumor growth model described in Ribba 2012. In this case, we
compiled the model into an R object `Ribba2012`, though in an RxODE
simulation pipeline, you do not *have* to assign the compiled model to
any object, though I think it makes sense.

# Simulating one event table

Simulating a single event table is quite simple: 

- You pipe the RxODE simulation object into an event table object by `et()`.  
- When the events are completely specified, you simply solve the ODE system with
`rxSolve()`.
- In this case you can pipe the output to `plot()` to conveniently view the results. 
- Note for the plot we are only selecting the selecting following:
  - `pt` (Proliferative Tissue), 
  - `q` (quiescent tissue) 
  - `qp` (DNA-Damaged quiescent tissue) and 
  - `pstar` (total tumor tissue) 

```{r}
Ribba2012 %>% # Use RxODE
    et(time.units="months") %>% # Pipe to a new event table
    et(amt=1, time=50, until=58, ii=1.5) %>% # Add dosing every 1.5 months
    et(0, 250, by=0.5) %>% # Add some sampling times (not required)
    rxSolve() %>% # Solve the simulation
    plot(pt, q, qp, pstar) # Plot it, plotting the variables of interest
```

# Simulating multiple subjects from a single event table

## Simulating with between subject variability

The next sort of simulation that may be useful is simulating multiple
patients with the same treatments.  In this case, we will use the
`omega` matrix specified by the paper:

```{r}
## Add CVs from paper for individual simulation
## Uses exact formula:

lognCv = function(x){log((x/100)^2+1)}

library(lotri)
## Now create omega matrix
## I'm using lotri to quickly specify names/diagonals
omega <- lotri(eta.pt0 ~ lognCv(94),
               eta.q0 ~ lognCv(54),
               eta.lambdap ~ lognCv(72),
               eta.kqp ~ lognCv(76),
               eta.qpp ~ lognCv(97),
               eta.deltaqp ~ lognCv(115),
               eta.kde ~ lognCv(70))

omega
```

With this information, it is easy to simulate 3 subjects from the
model-based parameters:

```{r}
set.seed(1089)
Ribba2012 %>% # Use RxODE
    et(time.units="months") %>% # Pipe to a new event table
    et(amt=1, time=50, until=58, ii=1.5) %>% # Add dosing every 1.5 months
    et(0, 250, by=0.5) %>% # Add some sampling times (not required)
    rxSolve(nSub=3, omega=omega) %>% # Solve the simulation
    plot(pt, q, qp, pstar) # Plot it, plotting the variables of interest

```

Note there are two different things that were added to this simulation: 
- `nSub` to specify how many subjects are in the model
- `omega` to specify the between subject variability.

## Simulation with unexplained variability 

You can even add unexplained variability quite easily:

```{r}
Ribba2012 %>% # Use RxODE
    et(time.units="months") %>% # Pipe to a new event table
    et(amt=1, time=50, until=58, ii=1.5) %>% # Add dosing every 1.5 months
     et(0, 250, by=0.5) %>% # Add some sampling times (not required)
    rxSolve(nSub=3, omega=omega, sigma=lotri(prop.err ~ 0.05^2)) %>% # Solve the simulation
    plot(pt, q, qp, pstar) # Plot it, plotting the variables of interest
```

In this case we only added the `sigma` matrix to have unexplained
variability on the `pstar` or total tumor tissue.

You can even simulate with uncertainty in the `theta` `omega` and `sigma` values if you wish.

## Simulation with uncertainty in all the parameters (by matrices)

If we assume these parameters came from `95` subjects with `8`
observations apiece, the degrees of freedom for the omega matrix would
be `95`, and the degrees of freedom of the `sigma` matrix would be
`95*8=760` because `95` items informed the `omega` matrix, and `760`
items informed the `sigma` matrix.

```{r}
Ribba2012 %>% # Use RxODE
    et(time.units="months") %>% # Pipe to a new event table
    et(amt=1, time=50, until=58, ii=1.5) %>% # Add dosing every 1.5 months
    et(0, 250, by=0.5) %>% # Add some sampling times (not required)
    rxSolve(nSub=3, nStud=3, omega=omega, sigma=lotri(prop.err ~ 0.05^2),
            dfSub=760, dfObs=95) %>% # Solve the simulation
    plot(pt, q, qp, pstar) # Plot it, plotting the variables of interest

```


Often in simulations we have a full covariance matrix for the fixed
effect parameters.  In this case, we do not have the matrix, but it
could be specified by `thetaMat`.


While we do not have a full covariance matrix, we can have information
about the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix from the model
paper.  These can be converted as follows:

```{r}
rseVar <- function(est, rse){
    return(est*rse/100)^2
}

thetaMat <- lotri(tpt0 ~ rseVar(7.13,25),
                  tq0 ~ rseVar(41.2,7),
                  tlambdap ~ rseVar(0.121, 16),
                  tkqpp ~ rseVar(0.0031, 35),
                  tdeltaqp ~ rseVar(0.00867, 21),
                  tgamma ~ rseVar(0.729, 37),
                  tkde ~ rseVar(0.24, 33)
                  );

thetaMat
```

Now we have a `thetaMat` to represent the uncertainty in the `theta`
matrix, as well as the other pieces in the simulation. Typically you
can put this information into your simulation with the `thetaMat`
matrix.


With such large variability in `theta` it is easy to sample a negative
rate constant, which does not make sense. For example:

```
Ribba2012 %>% # Use RxODE
et(time.units="months") %>% # Pipe to a new event table
et(amt=1, time=50, until=58, ii=1.5) %>% # Add dosing every 1.5 months
et(0, 250, by=0.5) %>% # Add some sampling times (not required)
rxSolve(nSub=2, nStud=2, omega=omega, sigma=lotri(prop.err ~ 0.05^2),
thetaMat=thetaMat, 
dfSub=760, dfObs=95) %>% # Solve the simulation
plot(pt, q, qp, pstar) # Plot it, plotting the variables of interest

#> unhandled error message: EE:[lsoda] 70000 steps taken before reaching tout
#> @(lsoda.c:750
#> Warning message:
#> In rxSolve_(object, .ctl, .nms, .xtra, params, events, inits, setupOnly = .setupOnly) :
#>  Some ID(s) could not solve the ODEs correctly; These values are replaced with NA.
```

To correct these problems you simply need to use a truncated
multivariate normal and specify the reasonable ranges for the
parameters.  For `theta` this is specified by `thetaLower` and
`thetaUpper`.  Similar parameters are there for the other matrices:
`omegaLower`, `omegaUpper`, `sigmaLower` and `sigmaUpper`. These may
be named vectors, one numeric value, or a numeric vector matching the
number of parameters specified in the `thetaMat` matrix.

In this case the simulation simply has to be modified to have
`thetaLower=0` to make sure all rates are positive:

```{r}
Ribba2012 %>% # Use RxODE
    et(time.units="months") %>% # Pipe to a new event table
    et(amt=1, time=50, until=58, ii=1.5) %>% # Add dosing every 1.5 months
    et(0, 250, by=0.5) %>% # Add some sampling times (not required)
    rxSolve(nSub=2, nStud=2, omega=omega, sigma=lotri(prop.err ~ 0.05^2),
            thetaMat=thetaMat,
            thetaLower=0, # Make sure the rates are reasonable
            dfSub=760, dfObs=95) %>% # Solve the simulation
    plot(pt, q, qp, pstar) # Plot it, plotting the variables of interest
```


# Summarizing the simulation output

While it is easy to use `dplyr` and `data.table` to perform your own
summary of simulations, `RxODE` also provides this ability by the
`confint` function.

```{r}
## This takes a little more time; Most of the time is the summary
## time.
sim0 <- Ribba2012 %>% # Use RxODE
    et(time.units="months") %>% # Pipe to a new event table
    et(amt=1, time=50, until=58, ii=1.5) %>% # Add dosing every 1.5 months
    et(0, 250, by=0.5) %>% # Add some sampling times (not required)
    rxSolve(nSub=50, nStud=50, omega=omega, sigma=lotri(prop.err ~ 0.05^2),
            thetaMat=thetaMat,
            thetaLower=0, # Make sure the rates are reasonable
            dfSub=760, dfObs=95) %>% # Solve the simulation
    confint(c("pt","q","qp","pstar"),level=0.90); # Create Simulation intervals
sim0 %>% plot() # Plot the simulation intervals
```

## Simulating from a data-frame of parameters

While the simulation from matrices can be very useful and a fast way
to simulate information, sometimes you may want to simulate more
complex scenarios.  For instance, there may be some reason to believe
that `tkde` needs to be above `tlambdap`, therefore these need to be
simulated more carefully.  You can generate the data frame in whatever
way you want.  The internal method of simulating the new parameters is
exported too.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
pars <- rxInits(Ribba2012);
pars <- pars[regexpr("(prop|eta)",names(pars)) == -1]
print(pars)

## This is the exported method for simulation of Theta/Omega internally in RxODE
df <- rxSimThetaOmega(params=pars, omega=omega,dfSub=760,
                      thetaMat=thetaMat, thetaLower=0, nSub=60,nStud=60) %>%
    filter(tkde > tlambdap) %>% as.tbl()
## You could also simulate more and bind them together to a data frame.
print(df)

## Quick check to make sure that all the parameters are OK.
all(df$tkde>df$tlambdap)

sim1 <- Ribba2012 %>% # Use RxODE
    et(time.units="months") %>% # Pipe to a new event table
    et(amt=1, time=50, until=58, ii=1.5) %>% # Add dosing every 1.5 months
    et(0, 250, by=0.5) %>% # Add some sampling times (not required)
    rxSolve(df)

## Note this information looses information about which ID is in a
## "study", so it summarizes the confidence intervals by dividing the
## subjects into sqrt(#subjects) subjects and then summarizes the
## confidence intervals

sim2 <- sim1 %>% confint(c("pt","q","qp","pstar"),level=0.90); # Create Simulation intervals
save(sim2, file = file.path(system.file(package = "RxODE"), "pipeline-sim2.rds"), version = 2)

sim2 %>% plot()
```
